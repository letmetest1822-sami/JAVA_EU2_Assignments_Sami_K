		 * Create a method that is called appendPosSum takes one parameter: 
		 * an ArrayList of Integers and returns an ArrayList of Integers
		 * This method should:
		 * Create a new ArrayList of Integers
		 * Add only the positive Integers to the new ArrayList
		 * Sum the positive Integers in the new ArrayList and add the Sum as the last element
		 * For example, 
		 	if the incoming ArrayList contains the Integers (4,-6, 3,-8,0,4, 3), 
		 		 the ArrayList that gets returned should be (4,    3,     4, 3,  14), 
		 * with 14 being the sum of (4, 3, 4, 3). 
		 * The original ArrayList should remain unchanged.
