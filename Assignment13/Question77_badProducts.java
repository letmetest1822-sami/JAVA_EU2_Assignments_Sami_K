		/*
		 * All products that go into the warehouse go through a machine that checks if they are intact. To declare if the shipment of the product was good or bad it also gets a limited number of how many products can be broken for it to be considered a good shipment.

badP is a method that gets an int array named products and an int named limit.

products(int[]) - is an int array representing the products it checked, if the item is intact it will be represented by 1 if it is broken its 0. for example: [0,1,1,1,0], this array represents 2 broken items and 3 intact.

limit(int) - represents the max amount of broken items for this shipment to be considered good (and the method returns true) for example: products [1,1,1,1,0] limit:3, there is only 1 broken product and it is less than the limit (3) return true.

Sample Output:

     badP([1,1,1,1],5)
     returns true

     badP([1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],2)
     returns false

     badP([1,1,0,0],2)
     returns false

     badP([1,1,1,0],6)
     returns true
