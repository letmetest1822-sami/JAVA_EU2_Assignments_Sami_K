		 * Scalar multiplication of matrix is the simplest and easiest way to multiply matrix . Basically you get an int 2d array and need to multiply each of its elements by the value of parameter n int. And return the same 2D array back.

Sample Output:

matrix =
[
[1,1,1]
[1,1,2]
]

scalar(matrix,5)

returns(after multiplying each value by 5):

[
[5,5,5]
[5,5,10]
]

--------------------

matrix =
[
[2,3,5]
[1,1,2]
]

scalar(matrix,2)

returns:

[
[4,6,10]
[2,2,4]
]


hint: use two nested for loops
